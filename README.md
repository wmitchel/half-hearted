# Half Hearted

A small single page site, built to be easily content manageable while also providing speed and responsiveness on any device or viewport.

## Integrations:

The site itself is built and deployed on Netlify. Any merges into the Release branch will trigger a fresh deploy on Netlify.
A failed build on a PR to release will prevent the PR from merging.

Data is sourced from Contentful. Contentful is configured with an app to trigger a new deploy when content is published.
